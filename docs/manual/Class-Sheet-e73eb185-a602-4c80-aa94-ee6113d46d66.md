Access and modify spreadsheet sheets. Common operations are renaming a sheet and accessing range objects from the sheet.

### Methods

[Untitled](./Untitled-0b9cda27-cfc1-422f-ba3b-5c888bc57db5.csv)

### `activate()`

Activates this sheet. Does not alter the sheet itself, only the parent's notion of the active sheet.

    // This example assumes there is a sheet named "first"var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();var first = ss.getSheetByName("first");first.activate();

### `addDeveloperMetadata(key)`

Adds developer metadata with the specified key to the sheet.

`[Sheet](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/sheet)` — This sheet, for chaining.

### `protect()`

Creates an object that can protect the sheet from being edited except by users who have permission. Until the script actually changes the list of editors for the sheet (by calling `[Protection.removeEditor(emailAddress)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#removeEditor(String))`, `[Protection.removeEditor(user)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#removeEditor(User))`, `[Protection.removeEditors(emailAddresses)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#removeEditors(String))`, `[Protection.addEditor(emailAddress)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#addEditor(String))`, `[Protection.addEditor(user)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#addEditor(User))`, `[Protection.addEditors(emailAddresses)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#addEditors(String))`, or setting a new value for `[Protection.setDomainEdit(editable)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/protection.html#setDomainEdit(Boolean))`), the permissions mirror those of the spreadsheet itself, which effectively means that the sheet remains unprotected. If the sheet is already protected, this method returns an object representing its existing protection settings. A protected sheet may include unprotected regions.

    // Protect the active sheet, then remove all other users from the list of editors.var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();var protection = sheet.protect().setDescription('Sample protected sheet');// Ensure the current user is an editor before removing others. Otherwise, if the user's edit// permission comes from a group, the script throws an exception upon removing the group.var me = Session.getEffectiveUser();protection.addEditor(me);protection.removeEditors(protection.getEditors());if (protection.canDomainEdit()) {  protection.setDomainEdit(false);}
