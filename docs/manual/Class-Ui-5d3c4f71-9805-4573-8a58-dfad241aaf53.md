# Class Ui 

[https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui)

![devsite-google-blue.png](devsite-google-blue-34d414b3-aa76-4a74-9335-a45596ac5723.png)

An instance of the user-interface environment for a Google App that allows the script to add features like menus, dialogs, and sidebars. A script can only interact with the UI for the current instance of an open editor, and only if the script is [container-bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/scripts_containers) to the editor.

    // Display a dialog box with a title, message, input field, and "Yes" and "No" buttons. The// user can also close the dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();var response = ui.prompt('Getting to know you', 'May I know your name?', ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);// Process the user's response.if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.YES) {  Logger.log('The user\'s name is %s.', response.getResponseText());} else if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.NO) {  Logger.log('The user didn\'t want to provide a name.');} else {  Logger.log('The user clicked the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');}

## Detailed documentation

### `alert(prompt)`

Opens a dialog box in the user's editor with the given message and an "OK" button. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but `[Jdbc](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/jdbc.html)` connections and `[LockService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service.html)` locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Display "Hello, world" in a dialog box with an "OK" button. The user can also close the// dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.SpreadsheetApp.getUi().alert('Hello, world');

### Parameters

`[Button](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/button.html)` — The button the user clicked.

### `alert(prompt, buttons)`

Opens a dialog box in the user's editor with the given message and set of buttons. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but `[Jdbc](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/jdbc.html)` connections and `[LockService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service.html)` locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Display a dialog box with a message and "Yes" and "No" buttons. The user can also close the// dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();var response = ui.alert('Are you sure you want to continue?', ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);// Process the user's response.if (response == ui.Button.YES) {  Logger.log('The user clicked "Yes."');} else {  Logger.log('The user clicked "No" or the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');}

`[Button](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/button.html)` — The button the user clicked.

### `alert(title, prompt, buttons)`

Opens a dialog box in the user's editor with the given title, message, and set of buttons. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but `[Jdbc](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/jdbc.html)` connections and `[LockService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service.html)` locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Display a dialog box with a title, message, and "Yes" and "No" buttons. The user can also// close the dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();var response = ui.alert('Confirm', 'Are you sure you want to continue?', ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);// Process the user's response.if (response == ui.Button.YES) {  Logger.log('The user clicked "Yes."');} else {  Logger.log('The user clicked "No" or the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');}

`[Button](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/button.html)` — The button the user clicked.

### `createAddonMenu()`

Creates a builder that can be used to insert a sub-menu into the editor's Add-on menu. The menu isn't actually be updated until `[Menu.addToUi()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/menu.html#addToUi())` is called. If the script is running as an add-on, the sub-menu name matches the add-on's name in the web store; if the script is [bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/scripts_containers) to the document directly, the sub-menu name matches the script's name. For more information, see the [guide to menus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus).

    // Add an item to the Add-on menu, under a sub-menu whose name is set automatically.function onOpen(e) {  SpreadsheetApp.getUi()      .createAddonMenu()      .addItem('Show', 'showSidebar')      .addToUi();}

`[Menu](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/menu.html)` — The new menu builder.

### `createMenu(caption)`

Creates a builder that can be used to add a menu to the editor's user interface. The menu isn't actually be added until `[Menu.addToUi()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/menu.html#addToUi())` is called. For more information, see the [guide to menus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus). The label for a top-level menu should be in headline case (all major words capitalized), although the label for a sub-menu should be in sentence case (only the first word capitalized). If the script is published as an [add-on](https://developers.google.com/gsuite/add-ons/overview), the `caption` parameter is ignored and the menu is added as a sub-menu of the Add-ons menu, equivalent to `[createAddonMenu()](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui)`.

    // Add a custom menu to the active document, including a separator and a sub-menu.function onOpen(e) {  SpreadsheetApp.getUi()      .createMenu('My Menu')      .addItem('My menu item', 'myFunction')      .addSeparator()      .addSubMenu(SpreadsheetApp.getUi().createMenu('My sub-menu')          .addItem('One sub-menu item', 'mySecondFunction')          .addItem('Another sub-menu item', 'myThirdFunction'))      .addToUi();}

`[Menu](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/menu.html)` — The new menu builder.

### `prompt(prompt)`

Opens an input dialog box in the user's editor with the given message and an "OK" button. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but `[Jdbc](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/jdbc.html)` connections and `[LockService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service.html)` locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Display a dialog box with a message, input field, and an "OK" button. The user can also// close the dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();var response = ui.prompt('Enter your name:');// Process the user's response.if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.OK) {  Logger.log('The user\'s name is %s.', response.getResponseText());} else {  Logger.log('The user clicked the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');}

`[PromptResponse](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/prompt-response.html)` — A representation of the user's response.

### `prompt(prompt, buttons)`

Opens an input dialog box in the user's editor with the given message and set of buttons. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but `[Jdbc](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/jdbc.html)` connections and `[LockService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service.html)` locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Display a dialog box with a message, input field, and "Yes" and "No" buttons. The user can// also close the dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();var response = ui.prompt('May I know your name?', ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);// Process the user's response.if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.YES) {  Logger.log('The user\'s name is %s.', response.getResponseText());} else if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.NO) {  Logger.log('The user didn\'t want to provide a name.');} else {  Logger.log('The user clicked the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');}

`[PromptResponse](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/prompt-response.html)` — A representation of the user's response.

### `prompt(title, prompt, buttons)`

Opens an input dialog box in the user's editor with the given title, message, and set of buttons. This method suspends the server-side script while the dialog is open. The script resumes after the user dismisses the dialog, but `[Jdbc](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/jdbc/jdbc.html)` connections and `[LockService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/lock/lock-service.html)` locks don't persist across the suspension. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Display a dialog box with a title, message, input field, and "Yes" and "No" buttons. The// user can also close the dialog by clicking the close button in its title bar.var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();var response = ui.prompt('Getting to know you', 'May I know your name?', ui.ButtonSet.YES_NO);// Process the user's response.if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.YES) {  Logger.log('The user\'s name is %s.', response.getResponseText());} else if (response.getSelectedButton() == ui.Button.NO) {  Logger.log('The user didn\'t want to provide a name.');} else {  Logger.log('The user clicked the close button in the dialog\'s title bar.');}

`[PromptResponse](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/prompt-response.html)` — A representation of the user's response.

### `showModalDialog(userInterface, title)`

Opens a modal dialog box in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method does *not* suspend the server-side script while the dialog is open. To communicate with the server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the `[google.script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/communication)` API for `[HtmlService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/html-service.html)`. To close the dialog programmatically, call  [`google.script.host.close()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/#serve_html_as_a_google_docs_sheets_or_forms_user_interface) on the client side of an `HtmlService` web app. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

Modal dialogs prevent the user from interacting with anything other than the dialog. By contrast, [modeless dialogs](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui) and [sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui) let the user interact with the editor. In almost all cases, a modal dialog or sidebar is a better choice than a modeless dialog.

    // Display a modal dialog box with custom HtmlService content.var htmlOutput = HtmlService    .createHtmlOutput('<p>A change of speed, a change of style...</p>')    .setWidth(250)    .setHeight(300);SpreadsheetApp.getUi().showModalDialog(htmlOutput, 'My add-on');

### Authorization

Scripts that use this method require authorization with one or more of the following [scopes](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/scopes#setting_explicit_scopes):

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui`

### `showModelessDialog(userInterface, title)`

Opens a modeless dialog box in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method does *not* suspend the server-side script while the dialog is open. To communicate with the server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the `[google.script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/communication)` API for `[HtmlService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/html-service.html)`. To close the dialog programmatically, call  [`google.script.host.close()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/#serve_html_as_a_google_docs_sheets_or_forms_user_interface) on the client side of an `HtmlService` web app. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

Modeless dialogs let the user interact with the editor behind the dialog. By contrast, [modal dialogs](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui) do not. In almost all cases, a modal dialog or [sidebar](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui) is a better choice than a modeless dialog.

    // Display a modeless dialog box with custom HtmlService content.var htmlOutput = HtmlService    .createHtmlOutput('<p>A change of speed, a change of style...</p>')    .setWidth(250)    .setHeight(300);SpreadsheetApp.getUi().showModelessDialog(htmlOutput, 'My add-on');

### Authorization

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui`

### `showSidebar(userInterface)`

Opens a sidebar in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method does *not* suspend the server-side script while the sidebar is open. To communicate with the server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the `[google.script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/communication)` API for `[HtmlService](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/html/html-service.html)`. To close the sidebar programmatically, call  [`google.script.host.close()`](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/html/#serve_html_as_a_google_docs_sheets_or_forms_user_interface) on the client side of an `HtmlService` web app. For more information, see the [guide to dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

The sidebar displays on the right side of the editor for users whose environments use a left-to-right language and on the left side of the editor for right-to-left languages. All sidebars shown by scripts are 300 pixels wide.

    // Display a sidebar with custom HtmlService content.var htmlOutput = HtmlService    .createHtmlOutput('<p>A change of speed, a change of style...</p>')    .setTitle('My add-on');SpreadsheetApp.getUi().showSidebar(htmlOutput);
