## Detailed documentation

### `create(title)`

Creates and returns a new `[Form](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form.html)`. Throws an exception if the given title is `null` or empty.

    // Create and open a form.var form = FormApp.create('Form Name');

### Parameters

`[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)` — if the given title is `null` or empty

### Authorization

Scripts that use this method require authorization with one or more of the following [scopes](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/scopes#setting_explicit_scopes):

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.currentonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms`

### `getActiveForm()`

Returns the form to which the script is [container-bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/scripts_containers). To interact with forms to which the script is not container-bound, use `[openById(id)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-app)` or `[openByUrl(url)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form-app)` instead.

    // Get the form to which this script is bound.var form = FormApp.getActiveForm();

`[Form](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form.html)` — the form to which the script is bound, or `null` if the script is not bound to a form

### Authorization

Scripts that use this method require authorization with one or more of the following [scopes](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/concepts/scopes#setting_explicit_scopes):

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.currentonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms`

### `getUi()`

Returns an instance of the form editor's user-interface environment that allows the script to add features like menus, dialogs, and sidebars. A script can only interact with the UI for the current instance of an open form editor (not the view that a respondent sees), and only if the script is [bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/scripts_containers) to the form. For more information, see the guides to [menus](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/menus) and [dialogs and sidebars](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs).

    // Add a custom menu to the active form, including a separator and a sub-menu.function onOpen(e) {  FormApp.getUi()      .createMenu('My Menu')      .addItem('My menu item', 'myFunction')      .addSeparator()      .addSubMenu(FormApp.getUi().createMenu('My sub-menu')          .addItem('One sub-menu item', 'mySecondFunction')          .addItem('Another sub-menu item', 'myThirdFunction'))      .addToUi();}

`[Ui](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/base/ui.html)` — an instance of this form's user-interface environment

### `openById(id)`

Returns the `[Form](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form.html)` with the specified ID. Throws an exception if the ID is invalid or the user does not have permission to open the form.

    // Open a form by ID.var form = FormApp.openById('1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz');

`[Form](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form.html)` — the form with the given ID

`[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)` — if the given ID is invalid or the user does not have sufficient permissions

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.currentonly`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms`

### `openByUrl(url)`

Returns the `[Form](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/forms/form.html)` with the specified URL. Throws an exception if the URL is invalid or the user does not have permission to open the form.

    // Open a form by URL.var form = FormApp.openByUrl(    'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_a1b2c3/edit'    );

`[Error](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error)` — if the given URL is invalid or the user does not have sufficient permissions
