# noReply

String: Boolean
if set, devices capable of rendering HTML will use it instead of the required body argument; you can add an optional inlineImages field in HTML body if you have inlined images for your email: true if the email should be sent from a generic no-reply email address to discourage recipients from responding to emails; this option is only possible for G Suite accounts, not Gmail users
