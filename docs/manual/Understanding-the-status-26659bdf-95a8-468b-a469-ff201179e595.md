# Understanding the status

In the system, there is only some few status that is **understandable** by the script, which includes: 

1. **Approved** - Approver approves that form, concludes that the form should be elevated to next step
2. **Rejected** - Approver rejects that form, concludes that the form is rejected
3. **Waiting** - System is still waiting for the response
4. **Others -** literally anything else rather than those three (they can caused by an error or a new entry response

Status will be change after the updates have occurred in that current response line. Please checkout how the status change, during the updates. Link is down below.

To edit the status by youself, please read the guidelines of 'Overriding the status'
