After you've created a form, you can add and edit up to 300 pieces of content, like questions, descriptions, images, and videos. To organize your form by topic, you can add up to 75 sections.

## Add questions, headers & sections

## Delete or edit items

To edit a question, header, or description, click the text you want to change.

## Randomly order questions and answers

You can have questions and answers appear in a different order for everyone who fills out your form.

**Note**: Questions and answers will only be shuffled once per email address. Make sure each address is entered separately and not sent to a Google Group.

## Change your default settings

To make every new form use the same settings:

1. At the top, click More **Preferences**.
2. Any setting you turn on will be the default for any new form.
